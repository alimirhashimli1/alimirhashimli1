Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a full-stack developer with a focus on building practical, user-friendly web applications. I enjoy solving real-world problems with clean code and modern tools.

## 👨‍💻 What I Do

I work mostly with the **MERN** and **PERN** stack (MongoDB - PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js), but I'm always exploring new technologies. Right now, I'm diving into **ASP.NET Core** to expand my backend skills and build cross-platform apps with C#.

I care about performance, accessibility, and good design—both in code and in user experience.
